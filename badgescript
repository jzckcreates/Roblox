Yeah, lets has a simpler script and then we will move on to the harder ones. This is a badge script, as you should know if you can read and this rewards game badges you've created
into a robloxian's profile.

I suggest you get a PC or Laptop for this to work and open Roblox Studio to get started, or you can test this script on a Roblox Baseplate Template or whatever
you want to do.

SCRIPT UNDER THIS:

local badgeservice = game.GetService("BadgeService")
local id = (Put your badge ID here and remove this in studio)
script.Parent.Touched:Connect (function(hit)

       if.HitParent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid") then
            local plr = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter (hit.Parent)
            badgeservice:AwardBadge (plr.UserId, id)
      end
  end)
